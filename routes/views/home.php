                            Are we afraid to ask these questions because of the answers we may get? Or is there simply no one to ask? Buying food these days is a mysterious, detached experience.

                            As recently as <strong>1945</strong>, nearly half of the fresh produce in America was grown in home and community gardens. Our production was so abundant that during World War II we shipped food overseas to Europe to aid our allies in their food shortages.
                        </p>
    
                        <p>
                            In about <strong>30 years</strong> food demand is expected to increase by up to <strong>98%</strong>. Some suggest clear-cutting even more forested land for greater commercial productivity. We believe the solution has been right under our noses (and in our backyards) the whole time.
